# clueless_recipes
Welcome to Clueless Recipies! This is a website where you can upload and access a database of recipes our users have created. This is very much still a work in progress
so please be patient with us while we work out the details. :)

Currently Working on:
Landing page HTML + CSS

Future Plans:
1. Create a form to upload your recipe to the database
2. Use JavaScript to request and submit data to the database
3. Allow users to interact with the main page to display a list of recipes, and select specific ones to view in detail
4. add a rating system for recipes
5. (MAYBE?) User authentication and unique website view per user (view your created recipes and submitted reviews)
